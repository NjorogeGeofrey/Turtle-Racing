# Turtle-Racing
The Turtle Racing Game is a fun and interactive program that simulates a race between multiple turtles using Python's turtle library. Users can place bets on which turtle they believe will win the race. The race begins, and in the end, the program announces the winning turtle, letting the user know if their bet was correct.
